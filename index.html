            <p>
                I have nothing but excitement to be taking this class and this is not the usual "I just need the credit so 
                I will have to pretend to be interested." I am genuinely interested because of how much I know that I have 
                no idea what the actual extent of data is. Like I know the dictionary term for data, but after going into the
                industry a litle bit, I have learned that comapnies run on data. When utlizing data correctly, it can tell a story
                that the naked eye could never see. However, just like how light can be maipulated to create illusions, data is more
                than often used to manipulate others to push the users agendas. Sometimes even done unknowingly. I just want to be able
                to have a glimpse of what data is. Plus, when aliens come and invade us and gets frustrated that we do not know, their
                language, I think the second best option is data visualization.

            <p>The data visualization I want to talk about being particularly helpful and insightful are heat maps. 
                Heat maps are a potent visualization tool, using color gradients to depict data density and concentration. 
                Their intuitive design allows for quick identification of "hot spots" and trends, making them ideal 
                for comparing data points and handling vast data sets. Heat maps proves their versatility through their 
                constant utilizations across fields such as biology, finance, web design, and of course, geography. However,
                 it is imperative to understand how easy it is to improperly manipulate heat maps such as choosing the 
                 wrong color scheme or using biased data. With temperature getting so hot, I felt like I had to talk about 
                 the heat map.

            <h1>Section 3</h1>
            <p>I think one of the most popular data visualization is often times misused and misinterpreted. That tool is the classic pie chart. I remember when in grade school, there would not be a poster I made in science class without a pie chart. Here is some examples on how they are flawed and misused.  
                Flaw: They can be hard to interpret when there are many slices or if the differences in sizes of slices are subtle.
                Misuse: Representing more than 5-7 categories can make the chart confusing. Moreover, the use of 3D pie charts can distort the perceived sizes of the pie slices.
